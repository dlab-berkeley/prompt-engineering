This repository contains the materials for D-Lab's Prompt Engineering workshop. 

### Prerequisites
No prior experience is required.

Check out D-Lab’s [Workshop Catalog](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/) to browse all workshops, see what’s running now, and review prerequisites.

## Workshop Goals

In this beginner-friendly workshop, we provide an introduction to prompt engineering using LLM chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini. Prompt engineering is the art of effectively communicating with AI to elicit desired results. We will offer an overview of LLM chatbots, and discuss several prompting techniques and tips.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand what prompt engineering is.
- What techniques you can use to improve your prompts. 
- What strategies you can use to resolve issues.

This workshop does not cover the following:

- The technical foundations of GPT and LLMs. These are covered in [GPT Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/GPT-Fundamentals).

## Resources

No installation is necessary. We will use the following resources:
- [The slides for this workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wtJCPiqzLwu5SL2eUH0N7KtHW-5IZd9Fe6-m3OOvO5Y/edit#slide=id.g25e89208c01_0_41).
